# About {{ site.name }}

<div>
<p style="float: left; width: 600px;">
{{ site.name }} is the various projects and musings of me, Will Speak. I am a computer science graduate and software developer. I have just finished my degree and am off into the world. I have an interest in <a href="{{ site.flickr_url }}" alt="My Flickr Site">photography</a> and a weakness for all things mac.

You can usually find me messing around with some form of software or another, and this has lead to the creation of many [projects]({{site.url}}/projects.html). When I have the time, or feel the need, I like to post my thoughts on my [Blog][blog].

You can follow me on Twitter as [@willspeak][twitter]. Don't expect me to tell you anything more interesting than the coffee i'm drinking though.

## Why Plingdollar?

It is a UNIX thing. It is a shell thing. It is what I say in my head every time I type `!$`, my second favourite shell command after `!!` (or possibly `sudo !!`).
