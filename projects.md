# My Projects

I have many projects on the go at [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/iwillspeak) and [Github](http://github.com/iwillspeak); most of them are just for fun. Here are some of the jewels in the crown:

* [Prattle](http://github.com/iwillspeak/Prattle) - A foolish or inconsequential experiment in precedence parsing. A Patt-style operator precedence parser written in Ruby.
* [Snooper](http://github.com/iwillspeak/snooper) - Spying on your files and running your tests. A ruby gem to watch for file changes and run arbitrary commands. 
* [Parsegen](http://github.com/iwillspeak/Parsegen) - Transform grammar files into working top-down parsers. A simple parser generator written in Python.
* [Thunker](https://gist.github.com/iwillspeak/5600085) - Home automation at its finest. A Linux daemon for the RaspberryPi designed to reset BT HomeHub routers when they crash.
* [Turf](https://bitbucket.org/iwillspeak/turf) - Object recognition with Grasmannian Manifolds. The source code for my final year university project, which uses manifolds and subspace distances rather than feature extraction to identify images in objects.
