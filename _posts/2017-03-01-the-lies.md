At the weekend I was listening to *Stereophonics ~ Performance and Cocktails*. The song *Half the Lies you Tell Ain't True* reminded me of a certain public figure. I have no idea why.

> But when you rely on a lie that's true,  
> And no one believes in the things you do  
> 'Cause half the lies you tell ain't true  

It's been stuck in my head ever since. My brain can't quite remember the verse, so it's substitutes some other *Stereophonics* lyrics instead:

> She longs to be another teenage dream,  
> The problem is she's turning forty three,  
> She still takes her clothes off.

Somehow, it seems to go.
